# AirQualityofBlackpool-U.K-using-python
AQI analysis is a crucial aspect of environmental data science.It aims to provide a numerical value representative of overall airquality,essential for public health and environmental management.
Below are the steps we can follow for the task of AQI analysis:
    1.Gather airquality data from weather monitoring websites,satellite imagery etc.I have obtained the dataset from the U.K Air site(https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/data_selector_service?show=auto&submit=Reset&f_limit_was=1).In this we can request for the data as per our requirements like we have the option to choose the data type,date range,monitoring sites,pollutants and the type of output we want.
    2.Clean and preprocess the collected data.
    3.Calculate the Air Quality Index using standardized formulas and guidelines provided by environmental agencies.
     Air Quality Index (AQI) involves multiple steps because it depends on specific concentration breakpoints for each pollutant. Here's a clear breakdown:#**Understanding AQI Calculation**
AQI is calculated for individual pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, Ozone, NO2, etc. The final AQI is the highest AQI value among all pollutants.

For each pollutant:
    

1.The concentration of the pollutant is compared to standardized breakpoints.

2.Using linear interpolation, an AQI value is calculated.
The formula for AQI calculation is:

            〖AQI〗_P=〖AQI〗_LOW+(C-C_LOW)/(C_HIGH-C_LOW )*(〖AQI〗_HIGH-〖AQI〗_LOW)


C: Pollutant concentration.
C_low and C_high: Breakpoints between which the concentration lies.
AQI_low and AQI_high: Corresponding AQI values for those breakpoints.

**Standard Breakpoints**
Here are the breakpoints for some common pollutants (based on UK and US EPA standards):


	PM 2.5(µg/m³)	
AQI	AQI Range	PM2.5 Concentration (µg/m³)
0	0-50	      0.0 - 12.0
1	51-100	      12.1 - 35.4
2	101-150	      35.5 - 55.4
3	151-200	      55.5 - 150.4

	PM10 (µg/m³)	
AQI	AQI Range	PM10 Concentration (µg/m³)
0	0-50	       0 - 54
1	51-100	       55 - 154
2	101-150	       155 - 254
3	151-200	       255 - 354

Ozone, NO2, and other pollutants also have their own breakpoint tables.

4.Create visualizations, such as line charts or heatmaps, to represent the AQI over time or across geographical regions.
5.Compare the AQI metrics of the location with the recommended air quality metrics.
